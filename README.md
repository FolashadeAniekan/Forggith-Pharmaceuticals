# Forggith-Pharmaceuticals 

## Background

Forggith Pharmaceuticals (Forggith) is a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing company based in Germany. As a manufacturing company, they produce medical drugs that reach consumers through their distributors.

Forggith provided a template for their distributors to capture records of their sales, which are then sent to Forggith on a monthly basis. This data is used for reporting and analysis by Forggith to achieve their Sales and Marketing objectives through tracking and monitoring of KPIs.

In their efforts to maximize growth, Forggith works with a team of Sales and Marketing professionals who ensure retailers can access their products through the distributors. Forggith does not sell directly to retailers or end-users; instead, they sell to distributors but maintain interactions with retailers through their Sales and Marketing team.
